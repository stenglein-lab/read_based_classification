# read_based_classification

This is a simple [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow /  pipeline to perform read-based metagenomic classification.  It is in the style of [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) pipelines and uses some [nf-core modules](https://nf-co.re/modules).  It uses [kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) to perform classification and [bracken](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/bracken/) to estimate species abundances.
